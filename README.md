# CMPG-323-Project-3---31607500
Project 3 of CMPG 323 

This project was about Implementing Repository patterns in Already existing code to improve our abilitie to work with existing code as well as new coding concepts

# Conetent

Understanding and changing existing code was something a had done only a few times before, it still takes time to understand code that I did not do myself but this experience has made it easier and allowed me to understand concepts in decipering existing code. I used concepts taught in class to update the existing code with the functions we needed to add, but due to time constraints I was not able to make all the necessary changes in time.

# Problems

The main issues came with getting Azure to work properly as there was issues with the account. It allowed me to connect when I started but later failed, I then used a link provided to the class which then also didnt work. The day before submision another link was provided and I could not get it working due to time constraints thus causing this project to be uncompleted and would likely remain so.

# Future

Although the project is not completed, I have the knowladge to finnish it but Azure is giving unnecesary issues thus making it hard to complete the project.
